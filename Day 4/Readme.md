## 1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) 🛠️

**Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** verifies the synthesized netlist, ensuring:

- ✅ Functional correctness
- ⏱️ Timing behavior
- ⚡ Power estimates
- 🔧 Test structures (e.g., scan chains for DFT)

### Why GLS?
| **Purpose**            | **Description**                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Synthesis Validation** | Confirms RTL-to-gate translation accuracy.          |
| **Timing Verification** | Checks for setup/hold violations using SDF files.   |
| **Testability**         | Validates scan chains and DFT features.             |

### When to Perform GLS?
- **Post-Synthesis**: After RTL is converted to a gate-level netlist.
- **Pre-Physical Design**: To catch issues before layout.

### Types of GLS
| **Type**          | **Description**                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Functional GLS** | Logic-only simulation (zero/unit delays).|
| **Timing GLS**     | Uses annotated timing data for real-world behavior. |

> [!NOTE]  
> GLS is a cornerstone of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, ensuring reliable netlists before tapeout with Synopsys tools and SCL180 PDK.

---

## 2. Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch 🚨

A **synthesis-simulation mismatch** occurs when RTL simulation (pre-synthesis) differs from gate-level simulation (post-synthesis) or hardware behavior.

### Common Causes
| **Cause**                     | **Example**                              |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Non-Synthesizable Constructs** | Delays, initial blocks, or unsupported code. |
| **Ambiguous Coding**           | Missing `else` clauses, incomplete sensitivity lists. |
| **Tool Differences**           | Simulation vs. synthesis tool interpretation. |

**Solution**: Write **synthesizable**, unambiguous RTL and adhere to best practices.

> [!TIP]  
> Simulate both RTL and gate-level netlists to catch mismatches early.

# 🚀 Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog 🔄

In Verilog, not all assignments are created equal! There are **two flavors** of procedural assignments, and choosing the right one can save you from subtle hardware bugs. Let’s dive into **Blocking** and **Non-Blocking Assignments** to master their use in VLSI design! 🎉

---

## 📑 Table of Contents

| **Section** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [1. Blocking Assignments (`=`)] | Understand blocking assignments for combinational logic. |
| [2. Non-Blocking Assignments (`<=`)] | Explore non-blocking assignments for sequential logic. |
| [3. Comparison Table] | Compare blocking vs. non-blocking assignments. |

---

## 1. Blocking Assignments (`=`) 📝

Think of **blocking assignments** as **strict line-followers**. Each statement **finishes completely** before the next one begins, like following a recipe step-by-step—chop the onions, *then* fry them!

- **When to Use**: Combinational logic (e.g., `always @(*)`).
- **Behavior**: Updates are **immediate**, so later lines see the updated values right away.
- **Analogy**: Cooking sequentially—you can’t fry onions before chopping them!

**Example**:
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    y = a & b;   // AND first, y updated immediately
    z = y | c;   // Uses updated y value
end
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Blocking assignments (`=`) infer combinational logic (gates) and are ideal for logic that doesn’t depend on a clock.

---

## 2. Non-Blocking Assignments (`<=`) ⏳

**Non-blocking assignments** are patient and fair. They **read all right-hand side (RHS) values first**, then update all left-hand side (LHS) values **together at the end** of the time step, preventing order-dependent issues.

- **When to Use**: Sequential logic (e.g., `always @(posedge clk)`).
- **Behavior**: Updates are **scheduled**, ensuring all assignments occur concurrently.
- **Analogy**: A team working in parallel—everyone gathers their materials, then updates together.

**Example**:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    q0 <= d;     // Schedule update for q0
    q  <= q0;    // Reads old q0, schedules update for q
end
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) infer sequential logic (flip-flops), critical for clocked designs like those in the RISC-V SoC.

| **Aspect**               |                    **Left Side Image**                                                                 |             **Right Side Image**                                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Example**         | ```verilog<br>always @(posedge clk) begin<br>    q <= q0; // (1)<br>    q0 <= d; // (2)<br>end``` | ```verilog<br>always @(posedge clk) begin<br>    q0 = d; // (1)<br>    q = q0; // (2)<br>end``` |
| **Line (1) Behavior**    | `q` gets the **old value** of `q0` (previous clock cycle).                                   | `q0` is **immediately updated** to `d`.                                                 |
| **Line (2) Behavior**    | `q0` is updated with `d` (scheduled for end of time step).                                   | `q` gets the **new value** of `q0` (which is `d`).                                      |
| **Effective Outcome**    | `q` and `q0` act as **two separate registers** (shift register behavior).                    | `q0` and `q` follow the **same signal**; only one register is needed.                   |
| **Synthesis Result**     | Creates **two flip-flops**: one for `q0`, one for `q`.                                       | Collapses to a **single flip-flop**: `q` directly stores `d`.                           |
| **Analogy**             | Like a relay race: `q` passes the old baton (`q0`) before `q0` gets a new one (`d`).         | Like a direct handoff: `q0` gets `d`, and `q` instantly takes it.                       |

    assign y = sel ? i1 : i0;
endmodule
```

---

### Lab 4: Bad MUX Example
**Description**: Demonstrates common Verilog pitfalls causing synthesis-simulation mismatches.  
**Original Code** (with issues):
```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
    always @(sel) begin
        if (sel)
            y <= i1;
        else

- Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) in combinational logic.

**Corrected Code**:
```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel)
            y = i1;

    reg x;
    always @(*) begin
        d = x & c;
        x = a | b;
    end
endmodule
```

**Issue**: `d` uses old value of `x` due to assignment order.  
**Corrected Code**:
```verilog
module blocking_caveat (input a, input b, input c, output reg d);
    reg x;
    always @(*) begin
        x = a | b;
        d = x & c;
    end
endmodule
