## 1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) 🛠️

**Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** verifies the synthesized netlist, ensuring:

- ✅ Functional correctness
- ⏱️ Timing behavior
- ⚡ Power estimates
- 🔧 Test structures (e.g., scan chains for DFT)

### Why GLS?
| **Purpose**            | **Description**                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Synthesis Validation** | Confirms RTL-to-gate translation accuracy.          |
| **Timing Verification** | Checks for setup/hold violations using SDF files.   |
| **Testability**         | Validates scan chains and DFT features.             |

### When to Perform GLS?
- **Post-Synthesis**: After RTL is converted to a gate-level netlist.
- **Pre-Physical Design**: To catch issues before layout.

### Types of GLS
| **Type**          | **Description**                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Functional GLS** | Logic-only simulation (zero/unit delays).|
| **Timing GLS**     | Uses annotated timing data for real-world behavior. |

> [!NOTE]  
> GLS is a cornerstone of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, ensuring reliable netlists before tapeout with Synopsys tools and SCL180 PDK.

---

## 2. Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch 🚨

A **synthesis-simulation mismatch** occurs when RTL simulation (pre-synthesis) differs from gate-level simulation (post-synthesis) or hardware behavior.

### Common Causes
| **Cause**                     | **Example**                              |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Non-Synthesizable Constructs** | Delays, initial blocks, or unsupported code. |
| **Ambiguous Coding**           | Missing `else` clauses, incomplete sensitivity lists. |
| **Tool Differences**           | Simulation vs. synthesis tool interpretation. |

**Solution**: Write **synthesizable**, unambiguous RTL and adhere to best practices.

> [!TIP]  
> Simulate both RTL and gate-level netlists to catch mismatches early.

# 🚀 Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments in Verilog 🔄

In Verilog, not all assignments are created equal! There are **two flavors** of procedural assignments, and choosing the right one can save you from subtle hardware bugs. Let’s dive into **Blocking** and **Non-Blocking Assignments** to master their use in VLSI design! 🎉

---

## 📑 Table of Contents

| **Section** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [1. Blocking Assignments (`=`)] | Understand blocking assignments for combinational logic. |
| [2. Non-Blocking Assignments (`<=`)] | Explore non-blocking assignments for sequential logic. |
| [3. Comparison Table] | Compare blocking vs. non-blocking assignments. |

---

## 1. Blocking Assignments (`=`) 📝

Think of **blocking assignments** as **strict line-followers**. Each statement **finishes completely** before the next one begins, like following a recipe step-by-step—chop the onions, *then* fry them!

- **When to Use**: Combinational logic (e.g., `always @(*)`).
- **Behavior**: Updates are **immediate**, so later lines see the updated values right away.
- **Analogy**: Cooking sequentially—you can’t fry onions before chopping them!

**Example**:
```verilog
always @(*) begin
    y = a & b;   // AND first, y updated immediately
    z = y | c;   // Uses updated y value
end
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Blocking assignments (`=`) infer combinational logic (gates) and are ideal for logic that doesn’t depend on a clock.

---

## 2. Non-Blocking Assignments (`<=`) ⏳

**Non-blocking assignments** are patient and fair. They **read all right-hand side (RHS) values first**, then update all left-hand side (LHS) values **together at the end** of the time step, preventing order-dependent issues.

- **When to Use**: Sequential logic (e.g., `always @(posedge clk)`).
- **Behavior**: Updates are **scheduled**, ensuring all assignments occur concurrently.
- **Analogy**: A team working in parallel—everyone gathers their materials, then updates together.

**Example**:
```verilog
always @(posedge clk) begin
    q0 <= d;     // Schedule update for q0
    q  <= q0;    // Reads old q0, schedules update for q
end
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Non-blocking assignments (`<=`) infer sequential logic (flip-flops), critical for clocked designs like those in the RISC-V SoC.

| **Aspect**               |                    **Left Side Image**                                                                 |             **Right Side Image**                                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Example**         | ```verilog<br>always @(posedge clk) begin<br>    q <= q0; // (1)<br>    q0 <= d; // (2)<br>end``` | ```verilog<br>always @(posedge clk) begin<br>    q0 = d; // (1)<br>    q = q0; // (2)<br>end``` |
| **Line (1) Behavior**    | `q` gets the **old value** of `q0` (previous clock cycle).                                   | `q0` is **immediately updated** to `d`.                                                 |
| **Line (2) Behavior**    | `q0` is updated with `d` (scheduled for end of time step).                                   | `q` gets the **new value** of `q0` (which is `d`).                                      |
| **Effective Outcome**    | `q` and `q0` act as **two separate registers** (shift register behavior).                    | `q0` and `q` follow the **same signal**; only one register is needed.                   |
| **Synthesis Result**     | Creates **two flip-flops**: one for `q0`, one for `q`.                                       | Collapses to a **single flip-flop**: `q` directly stores `d`.                           |
| **Analogy**             | Like a relay race: `q` passes the old baton (`q0`) before `q0` gets a new one (`d`).         | Like a direct handoff: `q0` gets `d`, and `q` instantly takes it.                       |

## 🧪 Lab 4: The Misadventure of the Bad MUX 😱

**📘 Overview**: This lab showcases a classic **multiplexer (MUX)** gone wrong, highlighting pitfalls that lead to synthesis-simulation mismatches. Let’s debug and perfect it!

### ❌ Problematic Code: The Troubled MUX
Here’s the original code, riddled with issues:

```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
    always @(sel) begin
        if (sel)
            y <= i1;
        else
            y <= i0;
    end
endmodule
```

**🚨 Issues Uncovered**:
- 🔴 **Incomplete Sensitivity List**: The `always @(sel)` block only triggers on `sel` changes, ignoring `i0` and `i1`. This leads to a mismatch between simulation (where outputs may not update) and synthesis (where tools assume combinational logic).
- 🔴 **Non-Blocking Assignments in Combinational Logic**: Using `<=` in a combinational block can cause unexpected behavior, as it’s meant for sequential logic.

<p align="center">
   <img src="dmux_wave.png" alt="GTKWave Counter Output" width="100%">
</p>

### ✅ Fixed Code: A Polished MUX
Here’s the corrected version, ready to shine:

```verilog
module bad_mux (input i0, input i1, input sel, output reg y);
    always @(*) begin
        if (sel)
            y = i1;
        else
            y = i0;
    end
endmodule
```

**🎯 Takeaway**: Always use `@(*)` for combinational logic and `=` for immediate updates to avoid sneaky mismatches!

---

## 🧪 Lab 5: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) of the Bad MUX 🔍

**📘 Overview**: Let’s run **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** on the problematic `bad_mux` to observe the chaos caused by its flaws.

**⚠️ Expected Behavior**:
- **Simulation Mismatch**: Due to the incomplete sensitivity list, the output `y` may not update correctly in simulation when `i0` or `i1` changes, while synthesis assumes full combinational behavior.
- **Tool Warnings**: GLS tools will likely flag warnings about the sensitivity list or mismatched behavior.

**🛠️ How to Test**:
1. Synthesize the original `bad_mux` using a standard cell library (e.g., Sky130).
2. Run GLS with a testbench toggling `i0`, `i1`, and `sel`.
3. Compare simulation results with expected combinational behavior.

**Command**:
```shell
write_verilog bad_mux_net.v
```
```shell
iverilog ../my_lib/verilog_model/primitives.v ../my_lib/verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v bad_mux_net.v tb_bad_mux
```

**📊 Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Complete Sensitivity List**: Switched to `@(*)` to automatically include all inputs (`i0`, `i1`, `sel`), ensuring proper triggering.
- ✅ **Blocking Assignments**: Replaced `<=` with `=` for combinational logic, aligning simulation and synthesis behavior.

<p align="center">
   <img src="dmux_gls.png" alt="GTKWave Counter Output" width="100%">
</p>

**🎯 Takeaway**: GLS exposes mismatches early, saving you from costly debug cycles in hardware!

## 🧪 Lab 6: The Blocking Assignment Trap 🕳️

**📘 Overview**: This lab reveals how the order of **blocking assignments** in combinational logic can lead to unexpected results. Let’s fix a sneaky bug in the `blocking_caveat` module!

### ❌ Problematic Code: Order Matters
Here’s the original code with a subtle but critical flaw:

```verilog
module blocking_caveat (input a, input b, input c, output reg d);
    reg x;
    always @(*) begin
        d = x & c;
        x = a | b;
    end
endmodule
```

**🚨 Issue Uncovered**:
- 🔴 **Wrong Assignment Order**: The output `d` is computed using the *old* value of `x` because `x = a | b` comes *after* `d = x & c`. This leads to stale data in simulation and synthesis.

### ✅ Fixed Code: Order Restored
Here’s the corrected version, ensuring logical flow:

```verilog
module blocking_caveat (input a, input b, input c, output reg d);
    reg x;
    always @(*) begin
        x = a | b;
        d = x & c;
    end
endmodule
```

**📊 Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Correct Assignment Order**: Moved `x = a | b` before `d = x & c`, ensuring `d` uses the updated value of `x`.

**🎯 Takeaway**: In combinational logic, order your blocking assignments carefully to reflect data dependencies!

---

## 🧪 Lab 7: Synthesizing the Blocking Caveat Module 🏭

**📘 Overview**: Let’s synthesize the corrected `blocking_caveat` module using **Yosys** and verify a clean, optimized netlist.

**🔧 Synthesis Instructions**:
Run the following Yosys commands to synthesize the module:

```tcl
read_liberty -lib sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog blocking_caveat.v
synth -top blocking_caveat
write_verilog blocking_caveat_netlist.v
```

**✅ Expected Results**:
- **Clean Synthesis**: No warnings or errors, as the corrected module uses proper sensitivity lists and assignment ordering.
- **Optimized Netlist**: The output `blocking_caveat_netlist.v` reflects the intended logic: `d = (a | b) & c`.

**🛠️ Verification Steps**:
1. Inspect the netlist for correct gate-level implementation.
2. Run GLS on the netlist to confirm matching behavior with RTL simulation.

**🎯 Takeaway**: Proper Verilog coding ensures smooth synthesis and reliable hardware implementation!

## 🔍 The Culprit Code: A Sneaky Combinational Block

Consider this seemingly innocent Verilog snippet, hiding a subtle trap:

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    d = x & c;   // (1) d computed using current value of x
    x = a | b;   // (2) x updated afterwards
end
```

**What’s Happening?**  
This combinational `always` block uses **blocking assignments** (`=`), which execute sequentially in simulation. But this order creates chaos! Let’s break it down step-by-step and reveal the mismatch drama.

---

## 🎭 Simulation vs. Synthesis: A Tale of Two Worlds

### 1️⃣ Simulation: The Stale Value Saga
In **RTL simulation**, the `always @(*)` block evaluates as follows:
- **Line (1)**: `d = x & c` uses the *current* (often stale) value of `x`.
- **Line (2)**: Only *after* computing `d` does `x` get updated to `a | b`.

**Result?**  
An artificial **one-cycle lag** where `d` reflects the *old* value of `x`. This creates incorrect outputs in simulation, making your waveform look like it’s stuck in the past! 😱

---

### 2️⃣ Synthesis: The Combinational Wizardry
Synthesis tools, like magicians, don’t care about the sequential order of blocking assignments. They see the `always @(*)` block as **pure combinational logic** and optimize it to:

```verilog
x = a | b;
d = (a | b) & c;
```

**Result?**  
In the synthesized netlist, `d` is computed using the *updated* value of `x` (i.e., `a | b`). This is the *correct* logic, instantly reflecting the intended behavior.

---

### 3️⃣ The Mismatch: When Worlds Collide 🌍💥
- **RTL Simulation**: `d` uses the stale `x`, leading to incorrect outputs.
- **Synthesized Netlist**: `d` uses the fresh `x` (i.e., `a | b`), producing the correct logic.

This discrepancy causes **waveform divergence**, where your simulation and hardware behave differently—a designer’s nightmare! 😵

---

## 🧪 A Real-World Example: The Mismatch in Action

Let’s illustrate with a concrete case. Suppose:
- Inputs: `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 1`
- Initial state: `x = 0` (stale value)

### Simulation (RTL):
1. `d = x & c` → `d = 0 & 1 = 0` (uses old `x`, oops! ❌)
2. `x = a | b` → `x = 1 | 0 = 1` (too late for `d`!)

**Output**: `d = 0` (incorrect, stuck in the past).

### Synthesis (Netlist):
- Logic: `d = (a | b) & c = (1 | 0) & 1 = 1`

**Output**: `d = 1` (correct, reflects intended logic).

**Mismatch Alert**: Simulation says `0`, hardware says `1`. Waveforms diverge, and chaos ensues! 🚨

---

## 🛠️ Best Practices: Taming the Mismatch Beast

To avoid falling into the synthesis-simulation trap, follow these golden rules:

1. **Order Matters for Blocking Assignments**:
   - In combinational `always` blocks, compute dependent signals in the correct order:
     ```verilog
     always @(*) begin
         x = a | b;   // Update x first
         d = x & c;   // Then use x
     end
     ```

2. **Use Continuous Assignments for Simplicity**:
   - Skip the `always` block entirely for combinational logic:
     ```verilog
     assign d = (a | b) & c;
     ```

3. **Reserve Non-Blocking for Sequential Logic**:
   - Use non-blocking assignments (`<=`) exclusively for sequential logic (e.g., flip-flops):
     ```verilog
     always @(posedge clk) begin
         d <= x & c;
     end
     ```

4. **Always Use `@(*)` for Combinational Logic**:
   - Ensure sensitivity lists are complete to avoid missing input triggers.

5. **Run Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**:
   - Simulate the synthesized netlist to catch mismatches early and verify hardware behavior.
