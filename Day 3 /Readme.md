## ðŸ”¹ 1. Constant Propagation

**Definition:**  
Constant propagation is a compiler/synthesis optimization technique that **replaces variables with constant values** wherever possible.  

**Process:**
- Identify variables that hold constant values.  
- Replace them directly in logic.  
- Simplify resulting Boolean expressions.  

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Reduced complexity (smaller circuits)  
- âœ… Improved performance (shorter critical paths)  
- âœ… Resource optimization (fewer gates/flip-flops)

## ðŸ”¹ 2. State Optimization

**Definition:**  
State optimization improves FSMs (Finite State Machines) by reducing the number of states or encoding them efficiently.  

**Techniques:**
- ðŸ”¸ **State Reduction** â†’ Merge equivalent states.  
- ðŸ”¸ **State Encoding** â†’ Use optimal binary codes for states.  
- ðŸ”¸ **Logic Minimization** â†’ Apply Boolean algebra/Karnaugh maps.  
- ðŸ”¸ **Power Optimization** â†’ Clock gating, gray encoding, etc.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Cloning

**Definition:**  
Cloning duplicates logic cells/modules to improve **timing, load balance, or power distribution**.  

**Steps:**
1. Identify timing-critical paths.  
2. Duplicate the bottleneck cell/module.  
3. Redistribute fan-out loads.  
4. Place & route cloned cells for better performance.  
5. Validate with timing & power analysis.

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Retiming

**Definition:**  
Retiming repositions registers/flip-flops in a circuit **without changing functionality**, to balance delays and reduce clock period.  

**Process:**
1. Represent circuit as a graph.  
2. Shift registers across logic gates.  
3. Preserve functional correctness.  
4. Optimize for minimum clock period or lower power.
